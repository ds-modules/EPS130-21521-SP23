    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "All surface waves, except Rayleigh waves in an isotropic half-space, exhibit dispersion, meaning waves traveling with different frequencies propagate with different speeds. As we have discussed previously seismic waves of a particular frequency travel with a phase velocity c(T). But, seismic sources radiate a spectrum of frequencies, which due to dispersion, interfere constuctively and destructively as they propagate. This gives rise to the concept of a \"group velocity\" U(T) which describes how a particular wave packet propagates. Please refer to Lay and Wallace Chapter 4.4 for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispersion of Love waves with period $T$ traveling with phase velocity $c(T)$, for layer 1 (crust) over half-space 2 (mantle), with repspective S-wave velocities $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$ and rigidity moduli $\\mu_1, \\mu_2$, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "(eqn 1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tan ( \\frac{2 \\pi}{T}H \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\beta_1^2} - \\frac{1}{c^2}} ) = \\frac{\\mu_2}{\\mu_1}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{c^2} - \\frac{1}{\\beta_2^2}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\beta_1^2} - \\frac{1}{c^2}}}; \\beta_1 \\leq c \\leq \\beta_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in lecture this equation comes from solving the boundary value problem for a layer over-a-halfspace model. Given the two shear wave velocities and the layer thickness of the model it is possible to then find for each frequency a value of c that satisfies this relationship. Figure 4.9 from the Lay and Wallace textbook, shown here,  illustrates intersection of the powerlaw function with the periodic tan() function. Note that tan() is for a specific frequency. The first tan() represents the fundamental mode, which is what we will focus on and the other curves represent the higher modes.\n",

    "The model group velocity dispersion relationship is then found by the following equation:\n",

    "(eqn 2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(T) = \\frac{c(T)}{1+\\frac{T}{c(T)}\\frac{dc(T)}{dT}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where group velocity depends on both c(T) and the rate of change of phase velocity (c) with period.\n",
